## Is web development a dying profession?


***


### Introduction
Over the last decade that I’ve worked in the IT industry, I’ve been approached several times and asked to build websites. Some of these clients have been aspiring entrepreneurs looking to get a business off the ground, others were established companies who decided it were about time they had a web presence. I’ve worked with web technology as it has grown and changed, and things are very different today to what they were a few years ago. When I began, you needed to know HTML, CSS and the package of choice was Adobe Dreamweaver. Throw in some Photoshop and Illustrator skills, plus some knowledge of hosting and security and suddenly things are starting to get quite complicated for the layman. Web Designers were considered specialists, and thrived with the .com boom.

Today, website building tools have evolved drastically. With the invention of systems like Wix and Squarespace, we are seeing a huge change within the web design industry. Almost anyone who wants a website can build a very attractive one using simple drag and drop right within their browser, no knowledge of SSL, programming or hosting required. 

Are these technologies killing the web design industry?

### Building Your Own
Most website building tools start the user experience with a choice of templates built by designers and programmers who have expertise in this field. A lot of work goes into this process, and the showcase websites demonstrate how effective it is. Templates have always been popular, with companies like WordPress really leveraging their communities creative skills to provide a huge range of options. Why would you want to learn how to code when you can have a barebones running in minutes. 

Templates are proof, like the popularity of microwave meals and takeaways, that **people like convenience**. 

That said, a template will only go so far. It’s not that uncommon that users will start to tweak object positions, change colour schemes and fonts, and add images that result in an extremely inconsistent result that would burn out the retinas of most experienced designers. Some people do not have an eye for design or aesthetic, and for them, it’s best to stick as close to the template as possible.

Other mistakes that people building their own site make include brand inconsistency, misaligned objects, failure to account for device variation, not adhering to mobile-first design, overusing widgets, not following a colour palette, using copyrighted images... the list goes on. 

This is not to say that people shouldn’t make their own. Learning design philosophies is great for any budding business owner, just as experimenting with flavours is good for an aspiring chef - but just like studying recipes, it’s important to do some research. Look at other websites, try to notice what stands out, what you like, how things are positioned, the experience of navigating from page to page. **UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) are equally important**.

### Hiring A Professional
Building a website from scratch is a large undertaking. As well as many of the skills already mentioned above, it’s important to have a solid understanding of the underlying web technologies to ensure the product is both secure and findable in a search engine, as well as understanding copyright and being proficient in design tools such as the Adobe Suite. Most of the standout visual or interactive features that you see on modern sites require an understanding of other coding libraries too (JavaScript, PHP, Python etc), and this is quite the rabbit hole...


If you have very specific requirements, want to incorporate bespoke features, want a stronger focus on brand alignment and identity, or just want something that looks unique next to your competitors template driven sites, then consider hiring somebody. There are platforms that allow you to hire internationally based freelancers at competitive rates, but again, you’re likely not going to get exactly what you want. 

Speak to somebody you know or have been recommended, and ensure that you can have a conversation with them about what your requirements are. **Try to understand why you want to build a website, and consider how much of an impact it will have on your companies growth**. The best web developers are consultants. They should make an effort to understand what your business needs, and propose a project that is mutually beneficial. 

You may find, that through speaking with a consultant, you discover more about your business than you’d expected. **It’s common that businesses self-diagnose a problem, and self-prescribe a website as the cure** - when in reality, the roots of the problem stretch much deeper.
